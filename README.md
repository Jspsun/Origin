One of my final projects that I did in high school. The game resembles the cell stage of the 2008 PC game [Spore] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(2008_video_game))

I had a lot of fun making this. From homegrown graphics to writing the graphics and collision systems, creating this was a blast!

##Features
-Enemy AI with pathfinding   
-Collision detection   
-Cell (player) customization
